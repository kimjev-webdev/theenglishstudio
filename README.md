The primary goal of this project is to build an intuitive and functional website for The English Studio, an English language school based in Milan. The website should provide a seamless booking system for a diverse set of students, offering various English courses designed to meet specific needs:

After-school English programs for children (primarily targeting Italian primary caregivers).
Test preparation courses for individuals planning to study abroad.
Business English and conversational English courses aimed at Italian professionals and tourists.
This platform should create an easy and enjoyable experience for users, enabling them to:

Book classes effortlessly.
Browse available courses based on their needs (children's courses, test prep, business English, etc.).
Access blog content related to English learning, teaching tips, and cultural insights.
Stay engaged with the school through a user-friendly interface that feels welcoming to both adults and children.
The website will also aim to:

Provide a responsive design for both mobile and desktop users.
Offer a clean and professional layout with a focus on ease of use, ensuring a pleasant experience for users of all technical abilities.
Enable simple navigation, guiding users to the right course, booking page, or blog post.
